# Analyze Network Attacks

**Objective:** Identify and analyze a potential DoS attack causing network interruptions.  
**Technologies:** Network analysis tools, TCP protocol, SYN flood attack

**Details:**

- **Identified attack type:** Diagnosed a potential SYN flood attack causing connection timeout errors by overwhelming the server with SYN packet requests.
- **Explained attack impact:** Detailed how the attack disrupted the TCP three-way handshake process, preventing legitimate connections.
- **Analyzed server logs:** Confirmed the attack by analyzing server logs that showed the server becoming unresponsive to SYN requests.

**Outcome:** Successfully identified and documented the nature of the DoS attack, providing actionable insights to mitigate future attacks.
